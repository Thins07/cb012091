                <p>With the kind of biodiversity Sri Lanka entertains, you wouldn’t want to miss out on a snorkelling/scuba diving adventure here! From April to September, the East coast is the place to be! If you’ve never been diving before, the PADI training centres position around the island could help you learn everything you need for a fulfilling experience underwater. Some of the best spots to go snorkelling include Pigeon Island, Nilaveli Beach and Pasikudah. The ideal spots for scuba diving are Trincomalee (this includes Pigeon Island and Nilaveli, as well as the enticing shipwreck close to the coast, Irakkandy), and Kirinda, which can be accessed only during March and April.</p>

                <p>Surfing is in its early stages in Sri Lanka. It’s only just started to take off, but there are tons of great spots to catch some waves along the island’s coastline. Arugam Bay is Sri Lanka’s most famous surf spot and accommodates surfers of all skill levels. The crescent-shaped beach gets a little packed during the surf season, but it’s still worth a visit!
                </p>

                <p>For beginners, the spot that’s highly recommended is Weligama Beach Break. There are plenty of instructors around the area advertising their classes, so you could learn how to surf on the spot! For the more experienced surfers, surf points like Rams, Lazy Left (Midigama), and Okanda are ideal locations.

                <p>Fishing is an ancient livelihood in the island nation, with almost every coastal town being utterly reliant on the industry to make a living. If you’re intrigued by the unusual fishing method known as ‘stilt fishing’, this would be a good time to find out what it’s all about! Along the beaches of Mirissa, Hikkaduwa and more, you’d see poles with crossbars attached to them and people precariously perched on them. The pole is embedded into the seabed along the shallow waters. The fisherman gets atop the crossbar, not disturbing the fish below. When they spot a fish, they use a rod to impale it, and then drop it into a bag. Stilt fishing is a traditional method employed by many fishermen in Sri Lanka, but it requires great balance, quick reflexes and a sharp eye, a bit too tedious for those who haven’t had the experience. You could instead opt for deep sea fishing, which is bound to get you a few larger, more challenging species to wrestle aboard.</p>

                <p>From Jet ski adventures to stand up paddle boarding, there are a variety of watersports to partake in along the gentle waters of the Bentota River. The town of Bentota is most noted as a hub for water activities as travellers can benefit from beach or river-related excursions.</p>

            <h2>Sea turtle Hatchery And Rescue Center in hikkaduwa</h2>
            
            
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            <p>The sea turtle is an endangered species. The main reason for this is human activity. There is an illegal industry trading turtle eggs, shells and meat. There are also turtles being injured by boats and fishing nets. Increase ocean pollution and is another factors that is quite harmful to the turtles.Going to the center is a great educational opportunity and allows you to get up close to the turtles without disturbing their habitat. The eggs har secured behind a netting so birds can not access them. Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are placed in a tank until they are ready to be released into the ocean. You are able to release turtles back into the ocean for an additional fee. The following map shows the sea turtle hatchery centers available in Hikkaduwa</p>
