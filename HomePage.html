                <h3>“Among the best destinations to travel to in 2023” – The Independent, UK</h3>
                <p>In the 13th century, explorer Marco Polo described Sri Lanka as “La più bella isola delle sue dimensioni in tutto il mondo” – the finest island of its size in all the world.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Sri Lanka is an island of Serendipity, a land of chance encounters and adventures, the home of innumerable treasures. An island deeply rooted in nature, history, heritage and values. It offers a myriad of experiences to truly immerse in authentic culture and unspoiled nature, a genuine excitement to the senses, a tug at one’s emotions.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>There are many reasons to Love Sri Lanka – whether it’s the year-round beach season, the stunning mountain landscapes, the mouth watering flavours of our cuisine, or the warm-hearted and generous islanders who are ready again to welcome you for the holiday of a lifetime!</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Tourism is back to normal and is playing a key role in our economic recovery. So come, visit our Paradise Island and fall in love with Sri Lanka all over again.</p>

            <h2>Aquos Mission & Objectives</h2>
            <p>The Turtle Foundation has seven country offices that are collectively committed to protecting sea turtles and their habitats worldwide. We want to prevent sea turtles from being cruelly killed and exterminated, their nesting beaches from being polluted and overbuilt, and their marine habitats from being contaminated and destroyed by plastic waste and other pollution.</p>
            <h3>Mission: </h3><p>Our mission is to contribute to sea turtle conservation at our own project sites by cooperating with local communities to create a future where both sea turtles and people can thrive.</p>
            <h3>Vision: </h3><p>Our vision  is a future where sea turtles and their habitats are sustainably protected, healthy, and safe from threat of extinction and destruction.</p>

                <h2>Turtle Population In Sri Lanka</h2>
                
            </div>
            <div class="desc">
                <p>The world’s oceans have been populated by sea turtles for 200 million years, but the seven species that exist today are now all threatened with extinction.  From the majestic leatherback turtle, which can reach a weight of up to 700 kg and dive up to 1,000 metres, to the pretty hawksbill turtle, which is hunted mainly for its turtleshell, all species of sea turtles are under pressure from humans hunting for their eggs and meat. The increasing destruction of their habitats is also putting pressure on sea turtles. All over the world, their nesting beaches are being built up with roads and hotel complexes, coral reefs are being damaged, and plastic waste is being dumped into the seas, where the turtles mistake it for their favourite food, jellyfish.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We want to contribute to stopping this fatal development! Please support us in this!</p>
